Using Power BI, I undertook the following meticulous steps to refine this ore:\n\n\nSource{[Item=\"OLTS Report\",Kind=\"Sheet\"]}[Data] This step imports the OLTS Report sheet data into Power BI. Here, initial inspection reveals two null rows that will need addressing later in the cleaning process.\n\n\n\nTable.TransformColumnTypes(#\"OLTS Report_Sheet\", {...}) Assigns the correct data type to each column of the table. This is crucial as it ensures that calculations and further data manipulations are performed correctly.\n\n\n\nTable.PromoteHeaders(#\"Changed Type\", [PromoteAllScalars=true]) Converts the first row of the dataset into column headers. This step is essential for turning a range of data into a structured table that Power BI can work with effectively.\n\n\n\nTable.Skip(#\"Promoted Headers\",14) Skips the first 14 rows, which are often metadata or formatting that are not relevant to the actual data analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.PromoteHeaders(#\"Removed Top Rows\", [PromoteAllScalars=true]) After removing the top rows, this step re-establishes the first row of the remaining dataset as headers, which may have shifted due to the previous steps.\n\n\n\nTable.FillDown(#\"Promoted Headers1\",{\"Identifier\"}) Ensures that all rows within a particular segment have consistent identifiers, filling down the value from the first row of the segment throughout its rows.\n\n\n\nTable.SelectRows(#\"Filled Down\", each ([Identifier] &lt;&gt; ...)) Removes rows based on the content of the Identifier column, filtering out rows with specific text like “Default” or “Loopback” that are not needed for analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.RemoveColumns(#\"Filtered Rows\",{\"Column2\"}) Removes unnecessary columns from the dataset, in this case, “Column2”, which may contain redundant or irrelevant information.\n\n\n\nTable.SelectColumns(#\"Removed Columns\",{\"Identifier\", \"Wave-#(lf)length #(lf)(nm)\", ...}) Narrows down the dataset to only include columns that are relevant for the analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.FillDown(#\"Removed Other Columns\",{\"Date/Time\"}) Applies the ‘fill down’ operation to the Date/Time column to ensure that all entries within a segment have the correct timestamp.\n\n\n\nTable.TransformColumnTypes(#\"Filled Down1\",{{\"Date/Time\", type datetime}}) Converts the Date/Time column to the datetime data type to enable time-based analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.SelectRows(#\"Changed Type1\", each ([Identifier] &lt;&gt; \"1310\" and [Identifier] &lt;&gt; \"1550\")) Excludes rows with the identifiers “1310” and “1550” if these rows do not contain data relevant to the analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.RemoveLastN(#\"Filtered Rows1\",1) Removes the last row of the dataset, which often contains totals or summary data not needed for individual data point analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.RemoveColumns(#\"Removed Bottom Rows\",{\"Column12\"}) Eliminates the last unnecessary column, further refining the dataset.\n\n\n\nTable.TransformColumnTypes(#\"Removed Columns1\", {...}) Ensures all columns that contain numeric values are set to the correct numeric data type, which is essential for accurate calculations.\n\n\n\nTable.AddColumn(#\"Changed Type2\", \"CableNumber\", each Number.FromText(Text.AfterDelimiter([Identifier], \"Cable_Fiber\"))) Adds a new column that extracts the cable number from the Identifier column, which is a key step for categorizing and segmenting the data.\n\n\n\nTable.TransformColumnTypes(#\"Added Custom\",{{\"CableNumber\", Int64.Type}}) Converts the newly added CableNumber column into an integer data type, which allows for numerical operations to be performed on it."

Despite their efficiency, these cables face significant challenges. Similar to how sound fades over distance, the light signals in fiber optic cables weaken during transmission. This attenuation, a form of transmission loss, can disrupt global communication, necessitating meticulous monitoring and maintenance.\nWhile there are many factors that can affect the transmission of light through these cables – like contaminated end faces, exceeding the bend radius, pinched jumpers, cracked fibers, and ferrule misalignment – we won’t be diving deep into the technicalities of these issues. Instead, as data scientists, our focus is on detecting these anomalies through data analysis. Our goal is clear: identify data points with significant transmission loss. This information, crucial for engineers, aids them in pinpointing and resolving issues in the network."
