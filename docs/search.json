Here, initial inspection reveals two null rows that will need addressing later in the cleaning process.\n\n\n\nTable.TransformColumnTypes(#\"OLTS Report_Sheet\", {...}) Assigns the correct data type to each column of the table. This is crucial as it ensures that calculations and further data manipulations are performed correctly.\n\n\n\nTable.PromoteHeaders(#\"Changed Type\", [PromoteAllScalars=true]) Converts the first row of the dataset into column headers. This step is essential for turning a range of data into a structured table that Power BI can work with effectively.\n\n\n\nTable.Skip(#\"Promoted Headers\",14) Skips the first 14 rows, which are often metadata or formatting that are not relevant to the actual data analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.PromoteHeaders(#\"Removed Top Rows\", [PromoteAllScalars=true]) After removing the top rows, this step re-establishes the first row of the remaining dataset as headers, which may have shifted due to the previous steps.\n\n\n\nTable.FillDown(#\"Promoted Headers1\",{\"Identifier\"}) Ensures that all rows within a particular segment have consistent identifiers, filling down the value from the first row of the segment throughout its rows.\n\n\n\nTable.SelectRows(#\"Filled Down\", each ([Identifier] &lt;&gt; ...)) Removes rows based on the content of the Identifier column, filtering out rows with specific text like “Default” or “Loopback” that are not needed for analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.RemoveColumns(#\"Filtered Rows\",{\"Column2\"}) Removes unnecessary columns from the dataset, in this case, “Column2”, which may contain redundant or irrelevant information.\n\n\n\nTable.SelectColumns(#\"Removed Columns\",{\"Identifier\", \"Wave-#(lf)length #(lf)(nm)\", ...}) Narrows down the dataset to only include columns that are relevant for the analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.FillDown(#\"Removed Other Columns\",{\"Date/Time\"}) Applies the ‘fill down’ operation to the Date/Time column to ensure that all entries within a segment have the correct timestamp.\n\n\n\nTable.TransformColumnTypes(#\"Filled Down1\",{{\"Date/Time\", type datetime}}) Converts the Date/Time column to the datetime data type to enable time-based analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.SelectRows(#\"Changed Type1\", each ([Identifier] &lt;&gt; \"1310\" and [Identifier] &lt;&gt; \"1550\")) Excludes rows with the identifiers “1310” and “1550” if these rows do not contain data relevant to the analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.RemoveLastN(#\"Filtered Rows1\",1) Removes the last row of the dataset, which often contains totals or summary data not needed for individual data point analysis.\n\n\n\nTable.RemoveColumns(#\"Removed Bottom Rows\",{\"Column12\"}) Eliminates the last unnecessary column, further refining the dataset.\n\n\n\nTable.TransformColumnTypes(#\"Removed Columns1\", {...}) Ensures all columns that contain numeric values are set to the correct numeric data type, which is essential for accurate calculations.\n\n\n\nTable.AddColumn(#\"Changed Type2\", \"CableNumber\", each Number.FromText(Text.AfterDelimiter([Identifier], \"Cable_Fiber\"))) Adds a new column that extracts the cable number from the Identifier column, which is a key step for categorizing and segmenting the data.\n\n\n\nTable.TransformColumnTypes(#\"Added Custom\",{{\"CableNumber\", Int64.Type}}) Converts the newly added CableNumber column into an integer data type, which allows for numerical operations to be performed on it."

Despite their efficiency, these cables face significant challenges. Similar to how sound fades over distance, the light signals in fiber optic cables weaken during transmission. This attenuation, a form of transmission loss, can disrupt global communication, necessitating meticulous monitoring and maintenance.\nWhile there are many factors that can affect the transmission of light through these cables – like contaminated end faces, exceeding the bend radius, pinched jumpers, cracked fibers, and ferrule misalignment – we won’t be diving deep into the technicalities of these issues. Instead, as data scientists, our focus is on detecting these anomalies through data analysis. Our goal is clear: identify data points with significant transmission loss.

    "text": "Step 6: Filling Down the Identifier Column\nIn many datasets, especially those with multiple attributes for each entry, it’s common to find gaps or inconsistencies. In the Identifier column, you might notice null values appearing intermittently. To address this, use the Fill Down function. This ensures that each row in the Identifier column is consistently populated, maintaining accuracy and continuity in your dataset.\n After selecting the Fill option, choose Down to propagate the data correctly in the Identifier column.\n\nThis step results in a fully populated Identifier column, which is essential for accurate categorization and analysis."

    "text": "Step 8: Transforming Data Type\nIt’s essential to ensure that each column in your dataset reflects the correct data type. This step, which involves setting columns to appropriate data types such as text, numbers, or dates, is fundamental for accurate interpretation and analysis. For instance, the Identifier column should be set as text, while the Date/Time column should be a date/time data type. Correct data types are vital for processing and analyzing your data accurately.\n\nTo change the data type, right-click on the column title, such as Date/Time, and select the appropriate type. This ensures each column is processed correctly in subsequent analyses.\n\nP.S.: It’s advisable to transform the data types towards the end of the cleansing process, after you’ve gained a better understanding of what the data looks like and which data type each column should be. The data types should now appear correctly set for each column, ensuring accurate processing in Power BI."

    "text": "Welcome back, data adventures! In our previous posts, we ventured through the process of cleansing our fiber optic data in Power BI. In this part of our series, we delve into a nifty Power BI trick – transforming the Identifier column to ensure it sorts numerically in slicers. This involves creating a new CableNumber column with a clever formula in Power Query (M language).\n\n\n\nOur Identifier column, containing values like Cable_Fiber1, Cable_Fiber2, Cable_Fiber3, etc., appears to be in order. However, when we use this column as a slicer in Power BI for visual filtering, the sorting does not display numerically as expected. Instead, it follows an alphanumeric order, leading to a non-intuitive sequence like Cable_Fiber1, Cable_Fiber10, Cable_Fiber100, followed by Cable_Fiber101, and so on.\n\n\n\n\nTo create a column that would allow for correct numerical sorting in our slicers, we used a formula in Power Query:\n= Table.AddColumn(#\"Changed Type2\", \"CableNumber\", each Number.FromText(Text.AfterDelimiter([Identifier], \"Cable_Fiber\")))\nAlternatively, to initiate the process of creating a custom column, we can simply click on the Custom Column icon in Power BI. This action leads us to a dialog where we input our formula, laying the groundwork for our new column.\n\nOnce in the custom column creation interface, we enter our formula, setting the stage for the transformation we’re aiming to achieve.\n This formula added a new column, CableNumber, by extracting and converting the numerical part from the Identifier column. Let’s break down the key functions used:\nText.AfterDelimiter: This function splits a text string based on a specified delimiter. In our case, it separates the text at Cable_Fiber, isolating the numeric part of our Identifier values.\nNumber.FromText: After isolating the numeric part, this function converts the text representation of a number into an actual numeric data type. This is crucial as it allows us to perform numerical operations and sorting.\nBy combining these two functions, we effectively created a column of pure numbers, corresponding to each cable’s identifier.\n\n\n\n\nWith the CableNumber column in place, our slicers in Power BI could now accurately sort the cables numerically, from Cable_Fiber1 to Cable_Fiber168.\n\n\nUsing the Sort by Column Feature: In Power BI Desktop, we right-clicked on the Identifier column and chose to sort it by our new CableNumber column.\n\nThis adjustment brought a logical numerical order to our slicers, greatly enhancing user experience and data analysis accuracy.\n\n\n\n\nFor our specific dataset, involving 168 cables (336 entries including different wavelengths), Power BI’s advanced data transformation features were pivotal. Power BI provided the necessary tools for detailed data manipulation, perfectly catering to our business needs and dataset size."
